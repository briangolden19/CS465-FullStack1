# Architecture
# Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
HTML is obviously a very basic framework to make the websites work. It helped create a good static start to the site but was not robust enough on its own to make a modern looking site. Using Express allowed me to add Handlebars calls into the website which helped create a more dynamic site. With the addition of JS, we were able to add proper logic to the website and this helped add security within the website. the SPA system completely changed the website and created a more interesting and containerized logic to the website.

# Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
The backend used the NoSQL database MongoDB because we were using different schemas for different aspects of the website. This allows for very diverse and far less restricted Database functionality

# Functionality
# How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
JSON is just a markup language which allows for the creation of Key-Value pairs. The JSON ties together with JS because it allows us to store data within easy to edit files and access this data very quickly from within JS.

# Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
The first major refactoring came from changing from using JSON files to hold trips and other bits of data, to using MongoDB. It was easy to change this because the components were very easy to find thanks to the reusable UI. Another instance where code was majorly refracted was when adding the security to the add and edit trip sections. This was nice because it was not hard to find the sections that needed editing.Â 

# Testing
# Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
When testing the different API endpoints, it was necessary to make sure we were using the correct methods, i.e. POST, GET, PUT, DELETE. In using the different methods we were able to create some different functions of the same API endpoints. For example just using GET on the trips api call only allows us to get the data we are looking for. If we were using PUT on the same trips endpoint, we were able to make edits to the existing data.

# Reflection
# How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
This course has showed me how interesting Full Stack development is and how this is something I would like to pursue as a career path. I feel like this class has shown me how to work with multiple languages and sections of a larger goal, as well as learning about basic security and troubleshooting in a bigger program. I feel comfortable that the skills I have learned within this class will be a great starting point to find a job within this field.
